#' Retrieve the time series feature derivation log content
#'
#' The Time Series Feature Derivation Log provides details about the feature generation process
#' for a time series project. It includes information about which features are generated and their
#' priority, as well as the detected properties of the time series data such as whether the
#' series is stationary, and periodicities detected.
#'
#' This route is only supported for time series projects that have finished partitioning.
#' The time series feature log will include information about:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Detected stationarity of the series (e.g. "Series detected as non-stationary")
#'   \item Detected presence of multiplicative trend in the series (e.g., "Multiplicative
#'     trend detected")
#'   \item Any periodicities (e.g., "Detected periodicities: 7 day")
#'   \item Maximum number of feature to be generated (e.g., "Maximum number of feature to be
#'     generated is 1440")
#'   \item Window sizes used in rolling statistics / lag extractors (e.g., "The window sizes
#'     chosen to be: 2 months") (because the time step is 1 month and Feature Derivation
#'     Window is 2 months)
#'   \item Features that are specified as known-in-advance (e.g., "Variables treated as
#'     known in advance: holiday")
#'   \item Details about why certain variables are transformed in the input data (e.g.,
#'     "Generating variable "y (log)" from "y" because multiplicative trend is detected")
#'   \item Details about features generated as time series features, and their priority
#'     (e.g., "Generating feature "date (actual)" from "date" (priority: 1)")
