#' Retrieve completed Feature Impact results given a model
#'
#' This will only succeed if the Feature Impact computation has completed.
#'
#' Feature Impact is computed for each column by creating new data with that column randomly
#' permuted (but the others left unchanged), and seeing how the error metric score for the
#' predictions is affected. The 'impactUnnormalized' is how much worse the error metric score is
#' when making predictions on this modified data. The 'impactNormalized' is normalized so that the
#' largest value is 1. In both cases, larger values indicate more important features. Elsewhere this
#' technique is sometimes called 'Permutation Importance'.
#'
#' Feature impact also runs redundancy detection, which detects if some features are redundant with
#' higher importance features. Note that some types of projects, like multiclass, do not run
#' redundancy detection. This function will generate a warning if redundancy detection was not run.
