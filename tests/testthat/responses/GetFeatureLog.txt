Series detected as non-stationary
Multiplicative trend detected
Detected periodicities: 12 month
Maximum number of feature to be generated is 400
The window sizes chosen to be: 6 months, 12 months (because the time step is 1 month and FDW is 12 months)
Variables treated as known in advance: 
Generating variable "passengers (log)" from "passengers" because multiplicative trend is detected
Generating variable "passengers (log) (12 month diff)" from "passengers (log)" because periodicity is detected
Generating variable "passengers (log) (diff)" from "passengers (log)" because non-stationarity is detected
