\title{Creates a waiter function that can be used in a loop while trying some task many times.
The waiter sleeps while waiting to try again, with sleep times determined by exponential

StartRetryWaiter(timeout = NULL, delay = 0.1, maxdelay = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{timeout}{integer. How long (in seconds) to keep trying before timing out (NULL means no
timeout)}

\item{delay}{integer. Initial delay between tries (in seconds).}

\item{maxdelay}{integer. Maximum delay (in seconds) between tries.}
