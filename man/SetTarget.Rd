\arguments{
\item{project}{character. Either (1) a character string giving the unique alphanumeric
identifier for the project, or (2) a list containing the element projectId with this
identifier.}

\item{target}{character. String giving the name of the response variable
to be predicted by all project models.}

\item{metric}{character. Optional. String specifying the model fitting metric
to be optimized; a list of valid options for this parameter, which depends on
both project and target, may be obtained with the function GetValidMetrics.}

\item{weights}{character. Optional. String specifying the name of the column
from the modeling dataset to be used as weights in model fitting.}

\item{partition}{partition. Optional. S3 object of class 'partition' whose elements specify
a valid partitioning scheme.  See help for functions CreateGroupPartition,
CreateRandomPartition, CreateStratifiedPartition, CreateUserPartition
and CreateDatetimePartitionSpecification.}

\item{mode}{character. Optional. Specifies the autopilot mode used to start the
modeling project; See \code{AutopilotMode} for valid options; \code{AutopilotMode$Quick} is
default.}

\item{seed}{integer. Optional. Seed for the random number generator used in
creating random partitions for model fitting.}

\item{targetType}{character. Optional. Used to specify the targetType to use for a project.
Valid options are "Binary", "Multiclass", "Regression". Set to "Multiclass" to enable
multiclass modeling. Otherwise, it can help to disambiguate, i.e. telling DataRobot how to
handle a numeric target with a few unique values that could be used for either multiclass
or regression. See \code{TargetType} for an easier way to keep track of the options.}

\item{positiveClass}{character. Optional. Target variable value corresponding to a positive
response in binary classification problems.}

\item{blueprintThreshold}{integer. Optional. The maximum time
(in hours) that any modeling blueprint is allowed to run before being
excluded from subsequent autopilot stages.}

\item{responseCap}{numeric. Optional. Floating point value, between 0.5 and 1.0,
specifying a capping limit for the response variable. The default value
NULL corresponds to an uncapped response, equivalent to responseCap = 1.0.}

\item{featurelistId}{numeric. Specifies which feature list to use. If NULL (default),
a default featurelist is used.}

\item{smartDownsampled}{logical. Optional. Whether to use smart downsampling to throw
away excess rows of the majority class. Only applicable to classification and zero-boosted
regression projects.}

\item{majorityDownsamplingRate}{numeric. Optional. Floating point value, between 0.0 and 100.0.
The percentage of the majority rows that should be kept.  Specify only if using smart
downsampling. May not cause the majority class to become smaller than the minority class.}

\item{accuracyOptimizedBlueprints}{logical. Optional. When enabled, accuracy optimized
blueprints will run in autopilot for the project. These are longer-running model blueprints
that provide increased accuracy over normal blueprints that run during autopilot.}

\item{offset}{character. Optional. Vector of the names of the columns containing the offset of
each row.}

\item{exposure}{character. Optional. The name of a column containing the exposure of each row.}

\item{eventsCount}{character. Optional. The name of a column specifying the events count.}

\item{monotonicIncreasingFeaturelistId}{character. Optional. The id of the featurelist
that defines the set of features with a monotonically increasing relationship to the
target. If \code{NULL} (default), no such constraints are enforced. When specified, this
will set a default for the project that can be overridden at model submission time if
desired. The featurelist itself can also be passed as this parameter.}

\item{monotonicDecreasingFeaturelistId}{character. Optional. The id of the featurelist
that defines the set of features with a monotonically decreasing relationship to the
target. If \code{NULL} (default), no such constraints are enforced. When specified, this
will set a default for the project that can be overridden at model submission time if
desired. The featurelist itself can also be passed as this parameter.}

\item{onlyIncludeMonotonicBlueprints}{logical. Optional. When TRUE, only blueprints that
support enforcing monotonic constraints will be available in the project or selected for
the autopilot.}

\item{maxWait}{integer. Specifies how many seconds to wait for the server to finish
analyzing the target and begin the modeling process. If the process takes
longer than this parameter specifies, execution will stop (but the server
will continue to process the request).}

\description{
This function sets the target variable for the project defined by
project, starting the process of building models to predict the response
variable target.  Both of these parameters - project and target - are
required and they are sufficient to start a modeling project with
DataRobot default specifications for the other optional parameters.
