\title{Refits an existing model to a different fraction of the training dataset}
\usage{
RequestSampleSizeUpdate(model, samplePct = NULL, trainingRowCount = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An S3 object of class dataRobotModel like that returned by
the function GetModel, or each element of the list returned by
the function ListModels.}

\item{samplePct}{Numeric, specifying the percentage of the training dataset
to be used in building the new model.}

\item{trainingRowCount}{integer. The number of rows to use to train
the requested model.}
}
\value{
Integer, value to be used as the modelJobId parameter in calling the
function GetModelFromJobId to retrieve the updated model.
}
\description{
This function requests a refit of the model defined by the model parameter
to the same training dataset used in building it originally, but with a
different fraction of the data, specified by the samplePct parameter.
The function returns an integer value that may be used with the function
GetModelFromJobId to retrieve the model after fitting is complete.
}
\details{
Motivation for this function is the fact that some models - e.g., very
complex machine learning models fit to large datasets - may take a long
time to complete.  Splitting the model creation request from model retrieval
in these cases allows the user to perform other interactive R session tasks
between the time the model creation/update request is made and the time the
final model is available.

Either `sample_pct` or `training_row_count` can be used to specify the amount of data to
use, but not both. If neither are specified, a default of the maximum amount of data that
can safely be used to train any blueprint without going into the validation data will be
selected.
In smart-sampled projects, `samplePct` and `trainingRowCount` are assumed to be in terms of rows
of the minority class.
