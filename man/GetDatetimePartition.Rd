\title{Retrieve the DatetimePartitioning from a project}
\usage{
GetDatetimePartition(project)
}
\arguments{
\item{project}{character. Either (1) a character string giving the unique alphanumeric
identifier for the project, or (2) a list containing the element projectId with this
identifier.}
}
\value{
list describing datetime partition with following components
\itemize{
  \item cvMethod. The type of validation scheme used for the project.
  \item projectId character. The id of the project this partitioning applies to.
  \item datetimePartitionColumn character. The name of the column whose values
    as dates are used to assign a row to a particular partition.
  \item dateFormat character. The format (e.g. "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") by which the
    partition column was interpreted (compatible with strftime
    [https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime]).
  \item autopilotDataSelectionMethod character. Whether models created
    by the autopilot use "rowCount" or "duration" as their dataSelectionMethod.
  \item validationDuration character. The validation duration specified when
    initializing the partitioning - not directly significant if the backtests have been
    modified, but used as the default validationDuration for the backtests.
  \item availableTrainingStartDate character. The start date of the available training
    data for scoring the holdout.
  \item availableTrainingDuration character. The duration of the available training data
    for scoring the holdout.
  \item availableTrainingRowCount integer. The number of rows in the available training data for
    scoring the holdout. Only available when retrieving the partitioning after setting the
    target.
  \item availableTrainingEndDate character. The end date of the available training data
    for scoring the holdout.
  \item primaryTrainingStartDate character. The start date of primary training data for
    scoring the holdout.
  \item primaryTrainingDuration character. The duration of the primary training data for
    scoring the holdout.
  \item primaryTrainingRowCount integer. The number of rows in the primary training data for
    scoring the holdout. Only available when retrieving the partitioning after setting the
    target.
  \item primaryTrainingEndDate character. The end date of the primary training data for
    scoring the holdout.
  \item gapStartDate character. The start date of the gap between training and holdout
    scoring data.
  \item gapDuration character. The duration of the gap between training and holdout
    scoring data.
  \item gapRowCount integer. The number of rows in the gap between training and holdout scoring
    data.
  Only available when retrieving the partitioning after setting the target.
  \item gapEndDate character. The end date of the gap between training and holdout scoring
    data.
  \item holdoutStartDate character. The start date of holdout scoring data.
  \item holdoutDuration character. The duration of the holdout scoring data.
  \item holdoutRowCount integer. The number of rows in the holdout scoring data.
    Only available when retrieving the partitioning after setting the target.
  \item holdoutEndDate character. The end date of the holdout scoring data.
  \item numberOfBacktests integer. the number of backtests used.
  \item backtests data.frame. A data frame of partition backtest. Each elemnet represent one
    backtest and has the following components:
    index, availableTrainingStartDate, availableTrainingDuration, availableTrainingRowCount,
    availableTrainingEndDate, primaryTrainingStartDate, primaryTrainingDuration,
    primaryTrainingRowCount, primaryTrainingEndDate, gapStartDate,  gapDuration, gapRowCount,
    gapEndDate, validationStartDate, validationDuration, validationRowCount,
    validationEndDate, totalRowCount.
  \item useTimeSeries logical. Whether the project is a time series project (if TRUE) or an OTV
    project which uses datetime partitioning (if FALSE).
  \item defaultToKnownInAdvance logical. Whether the project defaults to treating
    features as a priori. A priori features are time series features that are expected to
    be known for dates in the future when making predictions (e.g., "is this a holiday").
  \item featureDerivationWindowStart integer. Offset into the past to define how far
    back relative to the forecast point the feature derivation window should start. Only used for
    time series projects. Expressed in terms of the \code{timeUnit} of the
    \code{datetimePartitionColumn}.
  \item featureDerivationWindowEnd integer. Offset into the past to define how far back relative
    to the forecast point the feature derivation window should end. Only used for
    time series projects. Expressed in terms of the \code{timeUnit} of the
    \code{datetimePartitionColumn}.
  \item forecastWindowStart integer. Offset into the future to define how far forward relative
    to the forceast point the forecaset window should start. Only used for time series
    projects. Expressed in terms of the \code{timeUnit} of the \code{datetimePartitionColumn}.
  \item forecastWindowEnd integer. Offset into the future to define how far forward relative to
    the forceast point the forecaset window should end. Only used for time series
    projects. Expressed in terms of the \code{timeUnit} of the \code{datetimePartitionColumn}.
  \item featureSettings list. A list specifying settings for each feature.
  \item treatAsExponential character. Specifies whether to treat data as exponential trend
    and apply transformations like log-transform. Uses values from from \code{TreatAsExponential}.
  \item differencingMethod character. Used to specify differencing method to apply if data is 
    stationary. Use values from \code{DifferencingMethod}.
  \item windowBasisUnit character. Indicates which unit is the basis for the feature derivation
   window and forecast window. Uses values from \code{TimeUnit} and the value "ROW".
  \item periodicities list. A list of periodicities for different times, specified as a list of
   lists, where each list item specifies the `timeSteps` for a particular `timeUnit`. Will be
  \item totalRowCount integer. The number of rows in the project dataset. Only available when
    retrieving the partitioning after setting the target. Thus it will be NULL for
    \code{GenerateDatetimePartition} and populated for \code{GetDatetimePartition}.
  \item validationRowCount integer. The number of rows in the validation set.
  \item multiseriesIdColumns list. A list of the names of multiseries id columns to define series.
  \item numberOfKnownInAdvanceFeatures integer. The number of known in advance features.
  \item useCrossSeriesFeatures logical. Whether or not cross seris features are included.
  \item aggregationType character. The aggregation type to apply when creating cross series
    features. See \code{SeriesAggregationType}.
