\usage{
ListFeatureInfo(project)
}
\arguments{
\item{project}{character. Either (1) a character string giving the unique alphanumeric
identifier for the project, or (2) a list containing the element projectId with this
identifier.}
}
\value{
A named list which contains:
\itemize{
  \item id numeric. feature id. Note that throughout the API, features are specified using
    their names, not this ID.
  \item name character. The name of the feature.
  \item featureType character. Feature type: 'Numeric', 'Categorical', etc.
  \item importance numeric. numeric measure of the strength of relationship between the
    feature and target (independent of any model or other features).
  \item lowInformation logical. Whether the feature has too few values to be informative.
  \item uniqueCount numeric. The number of unique values in the feature.
  \item naCount numeric. The number of missing values in the feature.
  \item dateFormat character. The format of the feature if it is date-time feature.
  \item projectId character. Character id of the project the feature belongs to.
  \item max. The maximum value in the dataset, formatted in the same format as the data.
  \item min. The minimum value in the dataset, formatted in the same format as the data.
  \item mean. The arithmetic mean of the dataset, formatted in the same format as the data.
  \item median. The median of the dataset, formatted in the same format as the data.
  \item stdDev. The standard deviation of the dataset, formatted in the same format as the data.
  \item timeSeriesEligible logical. Whether this feature can be used as the datetime partition
    column in a time series project.
  \item timeSeriesEligibilityReason character. Why the feature is ineligible for the
    datetime partition column in a time series project, "suitable" when it is eligible.
  \item crossSeriesEligible logical. Whether the cross series group by column is
    eligible for cross-series modeling. Will be NULL if no cross series group by column
    is used.
  \item crossSeriesEligibilityReason character. The type of cross series eligibility
    (or ineligibility).
  \item timeStep numeric. For time-series eligible features, a positive integer determining
    the interval at which windows can be specified. If used as the datetime partition column
    on a time series project, the feature derivation and forecast windows must start and end
    at an integer multiple of this value. NULL for features that are not time series eligible.
  \item timeUnit character. For time series eligible features, the time unit covered by a
    single time step, e.g. "HOUR", or NULL for features that are not time series eligible.
  \item targetLeakage character. Whether a feature is considered to have target leakage or not.
    A value of "SKIPPED_DETECTION" indicates that target leakage detection was not run on
    the feature.
  \item keySummary data.frame. Optional. Descriptive statistics for this feature, iff
    it is a summarized categorical feature. This data.frame contains:
    \itemize{
      \item key. The name of the key.
      \item summary. Descriptive statistics for this key, including:
      \itemize{
        \item max. The maximum value in the dataset.
        \item min. The minimum value in the dataset.
        \item mean. The arithmetic mean of the dataset.
        \item median. The median of the dataset.
        \item stdDev. The standard deviation of the dataset.
        \item pctRows. The percentage of rows (from the EDA sample) in which this key occurs.
      }
    }
}
